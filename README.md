Languages and Tools for Programming I
=====================================

Projects for Languages and Tools for Programming I course (2015/2016), written in C++. 

The aim of this course is to teach specific programming tools and languages. The dynamic development of computer science results in new programming languages, environments and technologies emerging each day. The set of languages and tools which are worth being shown to the students enlarges each year. These topics are very important for everybody who wants to use computer science in practice. On the other hand the university curriculum is in a natural way aimed at showing those topics which are general enough and do not change to rapidly. To be able to combine these two attitudes (of novelty and of stability) this course has been introduced into the curriculum.

Seven assignments cover different paradigms of programming in C++ language (imperative, object-oriented, functional, basics of translation, declarations and types, template metaprogramming). A special attention has been paid to an object-oriented design and programming (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, hierarchy of classes).
